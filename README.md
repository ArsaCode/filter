Hello ! This is the Filter script made for the Problem Set 4 of CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course.
The user should input the key in the command prompt after the ./filter -b, g, r or s (for blur, greyscale, reflect or sepia) images/file.bmp out.bmp (input and output).

The software works as follows :

1 . Get the users input and checks if it's valid
2 . Applies the correct filter to the bmp file
3 . Outputs a new bmp file with the applied filter
